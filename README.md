# Zuul Jobs Board

Neatly presented statuses of periodic Zuul jobs.


## Overview

There are two components of `zjb` â€“ the puller and the server.

The puller periodically fetches the builds and stores results in local cache.

The server displays cached results from the local database (sqlite).


## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/sdatko/zuul-jobs-board.git
```


## Usage

The `zjb` utility is available after the project installation.

```
usage: zjb [-h] [-p] [-s]

Utility to run Zuul Jobs Board processes (puller, server or both).

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -p, --puller  run the puller process
  -s, --server  run the server process
```
